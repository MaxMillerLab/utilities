  # Git Commit and Push
  
  Commit and push changes in {{repo}} to {{branch}}. The steps are:
  
  1. Review all changes and write a detailed comment for the commit.
  2. If this is a branch linked to an issue, please include the issue number at the start of the commit summary
  3. Ask me if I want you to comment on the linked issue. I will want this if there are substantial changes. To do this, use either GitHub MCP tools or GitHub CLI.
